    "synopsis": "The series primarily takes place in a region called the Final Empire on a world called Scadrial, where the sun and sky are red, vegetation is brown, and the ground is constantly being covered under black volcanic ashfalls. Every night the land becomes covered in an unnatural mist or fog. One thousand years before the story begins, the ruler of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler, gained access to a divine power at what is called the \"Well of Ascension\", where he is rumored to have defeated the unknown danger called the \"Deepness\".[12] With this power, he remade the world and everything in it into its state at the beginning of the first book. In the Final Empire, a Dominance is a territory within the Lord Ruler's empire.",
